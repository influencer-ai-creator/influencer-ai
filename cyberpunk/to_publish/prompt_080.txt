Nova, a striking cyberpunk femme, with luminous skin and towering breasts, wearing a cut‑out black leather jumpsuit with neon trim, standing at low angle, bathed in dynamic back‑lit neon glow, her eyes sparkling with violet iridescence. She is shown mid‑action with her left hand gripping a hovering drone, right hand on her hip, a small cybernetic wristwatch glinting on her wrist. The background shows a bustling cityscape at twilight, with floating holograms and towering skyscrapers. The color palette is a vivid mix of electric blue and magenta, with a warm glow. The camera angle is a dramatic low‑to‑high angle. The lighting is cinematic, with rim light and soft rim shadows, and the atmosphere is futuristic, neon, cyberpunk. The composition includes other characters: a cyborg guard in a silver trench coat and a drone technician in a translucent jacket. The scene is captured in a cinematic wide‑shot style, with an emphasis on clarity and sharpness, ensuring that the main character is bright enough to be seen clearly. No genitals or nipples visible.
