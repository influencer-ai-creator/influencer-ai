Elara, a young adult woman with high cheekbones, big breasts, and a radiant smile, wearing a form-fitting black leather jacket with chrome accents, a translucent mesh top, and high-waisted black shorts that show off her curves. She is walking down a neon-lit alley, her cybernetic augmentations glowing. The camera angle is a low-angle shot, capturing her dynamic movement, with dramatic neon-blue lighting. The atmosphere is gritty urban, with rain mist and steam. The color palette includes neon blues, bright purples, and cool greens. Style is cyberpunk noir with a hint of hyper-realism. Include background characters: a hovering drone, a street vendor, and a neon sign. The composition includes a foreground crowd, a streetlight, and a billboard. She is bright enough to be clearly visible, and no genitals or nipples are visible.
