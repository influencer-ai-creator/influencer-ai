Hyperrealistic portrait of Lena, a young and stunning travel influencer, standing on the cliff of Santorini at golden hour, wearing a flowing off‑shoulder bikini top and high‑waisted shorts, sunglasses perched on her head, holding a vintage camera. The camera angle is a low‑to‑mid angle from behind, capturing her joyous expression as she points toward the turquoise Aegean Sea. Warm, pastel color palette with soft gold light, dreamy beach atmosphere, subtle lens flare, ultra‑detailed textures, and a slight bokeh background. The scene is rendered in a cinematic style reminiscent of high‑end travel photography, with emphasis on vibrant skin tones, sun‑kissed hair, and a hint of sea breeze.
