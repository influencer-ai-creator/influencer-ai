Photorealistic image of Lila, a young woman with an athletic build, wearing a light crop top and high-waisted jeans, standing on a cliffside promenade in Santorini. She is wearing a minimal gold-strap, with a subtle necklace, and she looks confidently into the camera, captured from a low-angle perspective during golden hour. The scene includes her friend Niko, a dog named Fido, and a local vendor serving fresh seafood. The composition shows Lila holding a camera and a latte, with a scenic view of the Aegean Sea behind. The lighting is warm, with a color palette of amber and teal. The style is photorealistic, with crisp details, soft focus, and a dreamy atmosphere. No visible genitals or nipples.
