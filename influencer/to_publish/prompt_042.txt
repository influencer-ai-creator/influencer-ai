A hyperrealistic portrait of Lena, a 24-year-old influencer with sun-kissed olive skin, long wavy black hair, and a captivating smile. She wears a bright, flowy sarong and stands on a cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea in Santorini at golden hour. The camera angle is low and slightly tilted, capturing her from the waist up with a wide-angle lens that includes the iconic whitewashed cliff houses and turquoise waters. Warm, soft golden sunlight illuminates her face, creating a subtle rim light on her shoulders, while a pastel color palette of blues, whites, and golds enhances the carefree atmosphere. The scene is rendered in cinematic film grain style with a slight bokeh background, emphasizing the well-lit, breezy beach setting.
