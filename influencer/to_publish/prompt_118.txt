A hyperrealistic 35mm photograph style of Lena, a 23-year-old influencer with olive skin, long wavy dark hair, bright green eyes, wearing a turquoise bikini with floral pattern, standing on a cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea in Santorini, Greece, during golden hour. The camera is shot from a low angle, slightly tilted to emphasize the expansive sky and the vibrant turquoise water below. The scene is bathed in warm, golden light with rim lighting on her hair, creating a serene, dreamy atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by warm golds, deep blues, and stark whites of the cliff and buildings, with the bikini adding a pop of turquoise. The composition includes distant whitewashed buildings and a sailboat on the horizon. The image has cinematic depth of field, with sharp focus on Lena and a soft background, evoking a cinematic travel vlog aesthetic.
