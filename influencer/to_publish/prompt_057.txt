Photorealistic portrait of Lena, a stunning 24‑year‑old woman with long wavy dark hair, a bright smile, wearing a vibrant red bikini, standing on a cliff overlooking the Aegean Sea at golden hour. The camera is a close‑up low‑angle shot, the sun behind her casting a warm, soft rim light that highlights her features and the shimmering water below. The scene is vivid and saturated with warm tones, capturing the sparkling blue sea, the white cliffs of Santorini, and the clear turquoise sky. Include a subtle pastel watercolor overlay for a dreamy atmosphere, with high detail and sharp focus on Lena's eyes, freckles, and the texture of the waves. The composition exudes a carefree travel vibe and a touch of artistic elegance.
