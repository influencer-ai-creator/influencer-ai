Photorealistic low‑angle portrait of LENA, a young adult woman with flowing golden hair and piercing blue eyes, wearing a leopard‑print crop top and high‑waist denim shorts, standing on the sandy beach of Lake Bled, Slovenia, with a local guide in a vintage truck beside her, all framed in a warm pastel palette and vibrant atmosphere, shot with a wide‑lens camera, capturing the moment of her walking along the shore, with the sun glinting on the water and a distant mountain backdrop, detailed in high resolution, cinematic lighting, and a subtle soft focus to bring out the natural beauty of the scene.
