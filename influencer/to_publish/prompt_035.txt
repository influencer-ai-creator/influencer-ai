Low-angle portrait of Mia on a sunny Okinawan beach, wearing a low-cut turquoise bikini, her sun-kissed skin glowing, long hair flowing in the breeze, smiling brightly. Golden hour light bathes the scene, creating warm, pastel tones. The background features gentle turquoise waves, a sandy shoreline, and a playful seagull perched nearby. The style is realistic with painterly brushstrokes, capturing a serene, uplifting atmosphere.
