A hyper-realistic cinematic portrait of Mia, a young adult travel influencer with olive skin, dark wavy hair falling over her shoulders, wearing a low-cut turquoise bikini, standing on the cliff edge of Santorini at golden hour, capturing the view with a handheld camera, a radiant smile, and a gentle breeze. The composition uses a low-angle perspective, vibrant pastel color palette, soft golden light illuminating her face and the Aegean sea, creating a dreamy, inspirational atmosphere. The focus is on her joyful expression and the dynamic movement of her hair, with subtle reflections on the sea, capturing the essence of travel freedom.
