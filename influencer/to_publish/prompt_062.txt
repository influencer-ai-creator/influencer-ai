hyper‑realistic portrait of Lena, a young, stunning influencer with olive skin, long flowing golden hair, wearing a low‑cut off‑shoulder summer dress, standing on a cliff overlooking Santorini’s Aegean Sea at golden hour. The scene is captured from a low‑angle shot that emphasizes her joyful expression and the expansive horizon, with warm golden light casting soft highlights and subtle rim lighting on her hair and dress. The atmosphere feels dreamy and serene, with a pastel color palette of warm oranges, golden yellows, and turquoise blues, enhanced by a slight watercolor brushstroke overlay for a romantic, cinematic feel. The composition includes a clear sky, distant whitewashed buildings, and the sparkling sea, all bathed in a soft, natural glow. --ar 16:9 --v 5
