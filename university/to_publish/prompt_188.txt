A hyperrealistic, well-lit scene captured at a 45-degree angle from below, featuring Sofia, an adult European woman with strikingly large breasts and a toned silhouette, wearing a minimalist yet daring teacherâ€™s outfit that accentuates her curves, as she energetically flips a stack of lecture notes in front of a bright, golden hour backdrop; her hair is pulled back in a subtle braid, her eyes are glowing, her pupils are wide, and her smile is contagious. The background is a university courtyard with lush plants, a white-walled building, and a soft, warm earth-toned palette. The camera captures the action in cinematic detail, with light from a late afternoon sun casting soft shadows and highlights; the composition focuses on her movement, her hands, and the swirling motion of her notebook stack. The lighting is warm, romantic, with golden hour tones, and the style is hyperrealistic with a cinematic feel. The composition includes two additional characters, a younger student and a supportive colleague, both looking on as Sofia moves. The prompt is for a stable diffusion model.
