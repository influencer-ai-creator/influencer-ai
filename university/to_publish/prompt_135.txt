A high-angle, hyper-realistic portrait of Elena, a European adult French professor, standing in a brightly lit biology lab during golden hour, her short white blouse and knee-length skirt revealing her ample bust. She leans over a glossy lab bench, a beaker spilling turquoise water onto a petri dish, her long hair cascading down her shoulders, her eyes sparkling with mischief. In the background, a male student named Marco, with a nervous grin, watches her from a nearby desk. The atmosphere is sensual and moody, with warm golden tones and a soft, diffused light that highlights the wet sheen on her skin and the crystal droplets. The composition emphasizes her curves and the dramatic interplay of light and shadow, capturing a moment of academic seduction in a university setting.
