A hyperrealistic illustration of Mara, a statuesque European professor with flowing golden hair, a curvaceous figure, wearing a cropped leather blazer over a short lace skirt, standing in a brightly lit lecture hall with rows of desks. The scene is captured from a low angle, looking up at her as natural sunlight streams through large high windows, casting warm golden hour light across the room. A group of diverse students watches her in awe, their expressions a mix of curiosity and fascination. The color palette is warm and saturated, with rich golds, deep blues, and pops of crimson, creating a surreal, playful atmosphere that highlights the exaggerated, erotic elegance of the moment.
