A vibrant, well-lit university lecture hall, captured from a low angled perspective, with sunlight pouring through the large windows, highlighting the scene. The main character, Evelyn, is depicted as a European adult woman in a form-fitting teal blouse and a silk pencil skirt, standing at the podium, gesturing dramatically. Her long wavy hair frames her face, her eyes gleaming, and she has large breasts and a tall, slender frame, but no genitals or nipples visible. The camera angle is a low, angled shot capturing her head and shoulders. The lighting is warm, golden hour, creating a luminous atmosphere. The color palette is rich earthy tones with subtle blue accents. The style is hyperrealistic with a touch of impressionist flair. Additional characters: two students in the front row, and the professor's assistant in the back. The scene is bathed in warm light from the sun, with subtle reflections on the polished wood desk. The main action is Evelyn raising a chalk diagram while engaging the class.
