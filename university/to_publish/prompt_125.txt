A brightly lit university lecture hall, mid-shot of Professor Eliza, a European adult woman from France, with long golden-blonde hair and a curvy figure, large breasts prominently displayed beneath a low-cut ivory blouse and a short navy skirt. She stands confidently at the front, holding a stack of textbooks, flipping one with a flirtatious smile, while a few male students in the audience watch her. The scene is shot from a slight side angle, backlit by natural sunlight streaming through large windows, creating a warm, golden glow that highlights her skin and the sheen of her blouse. The color palette is pastel and vibrant, with soft blues, warm golds, and subtle pinks. The style is a realistic digital painting with high detail and crisp textures, emphasizing the elegance and sensuality of the moment, while keeping the atmosphere respectful and academically appropriate.
