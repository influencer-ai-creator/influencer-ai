A luminous, well-lit lecture hall scene, camera angle from low-angle overhead, with warm ambient lighting, high dynamic range color palette, soft pastel hues, and subtle bokeh; main character: Professor Liora Vega, a European adult woman with long wavy hair, luminous skin, big breasts, slender waist, wearing a sheer silk blouse with a low-cut neckline, standing confidently in front of a blackboard, while her assistant Marcus, a European male student, stands behind her with a chalk in hand; the scene rendered in realistic style with cinematic lighting, depth of field, and a soft glow; the camera captures her expressive gesture, the motion of her hands, and the detailed fabric texture; the lighting highlights the contours of her face and body, giving a sense of sensuality; overall style photorealistic with emphasis on color harmony and clarity.
