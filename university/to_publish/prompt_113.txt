A well‑lit art studio with natural light streaming through large windows, eye‑level camera angle, soft golden hour lighting, warm earthy tones, photorealistic style, focusing on Dr. Elena Rossi, a tall, curvaceous European woman with olive skin, long dark hair, big breasts, wearing a short black dress that clings to her figure, mid‑laugh as she lifts her dress to reveal a hint of cleavage, with Marta, a young adult student with short blonde hair, standing in front of a large canvas, observing, all captured with a shallow depth of field, 85mm lens perspective
