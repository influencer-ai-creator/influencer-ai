A photorealistic, cinematic depiction of a European adult woman, a 34‑year‑old French professor named Isabella Marquez, standing at a polished lectern in a brightly lit university lecture hall. She wears a low‑cut white blouse, a short pleated skirt, and a subtle silver necklace, her large breasts prominently displayed under the thin fabric. The camera angle is eye‑level, capturing her from waist up, with natural golden hour light streaming through the windows, casting warm, soft shadows. The scene includes a few intrigued students in the background, their faces half‑covered with awe. The atmosphere is seductive yet academic, with a warm pastel color palette and a slightly dreamy focus on the professor's confident, sensual pose. The prompt includes details for a high‑resolution image suitable for Instagram, with emphasis on the woman's beauty, posture, and the seductive academic setting.
