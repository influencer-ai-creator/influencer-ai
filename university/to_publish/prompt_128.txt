A cinematic, low-angle, well-lit shot of a European adult woman, Professor Lena, standing confidently in a modern lecture hall. She wears a cropped off-shoulder top and a pleated mini skirt, revealing a toned midriff, while her long dark hair falls in loose waves. The golden hour sunlight floods the room, casting soft shadows and highlighting her curves. A group of students sit at desks, their faces illuminated by the light, eyes drawn to her. The atmosphere is energetic and slightly seductive, with a warm color palette and a crisp, high-fashion editorial style.
