Photorealistic portrait of Marta, a European adult woman with long black hair, porcelain skin, striking blue eyes, and an exaggerated bust, wearing a cropped plaid skirt and a short black blazer, standing in a brightly lit university lecture hall with large windows casting golden hour light. The low-angle shot captures her confidently leaning forward to hand a stack of assignments to a captivated student, while a male professor looks on in stunned admiration. The atmosphere is electric and playful, with warm, saturated colors, soft studio lights accentuating her curves, and the background filled with desks, a whiteboard, and a few other students.
