A high‑angle shot of a European adult woman professor, Isabelle Laurent, standing in a sunlit university courtyard, her form accentuated by a revealing silk blouse and a skirt that grazes her knees, with a golden hour glow. She holds a stack of lecture notes, her long blonde hair cascading over her shoulders, as she smiles mischievously at a group of intrigued students. The scene is painted in a hyper‑realistic style with soft pastel tones, featuring a vibrant, lively atmosphere with students in casual summer attire. The lighting is warm, diffused, and dramatic, capturing the sensual details of Isabelle's posture and the glossy sheen of her polished shoes. --ar 3:2 --q 2 --v 5
