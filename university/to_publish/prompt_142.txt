A low-angle, hyperrealistic cinematic shot of a French professor named Lila standing in a bright lecture hall, her thigh-high stockings and short silk blouse revealing her curvaceous figure. She is mid-action, holding a stack of calculus notes and winking, with a velvet chaise behind her. Students in the background are drawn in with subtle focus, their expressions captivated. The lighting is golden hour, warm amber tones, a dreamy atmosphere, with a soft bokeh background. The style is photorealistic, cinematic with a high dynamic range, capturing every detail of her striking beauty and the luxurious interior.
