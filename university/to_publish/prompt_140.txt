Side view of Lena, a tall European adult woman with olive skin, long wavy brunette hair, striking green eyes, and a voluptuous bust, wearing a cropped white blouse and a low‑rise silk skirt. She stands in a bright, well‑lit lecture hall, holding a stack of books, with a few students—two male, one female—in classic school uniforms watching her. The scene is vibrant with pastel colors, hyper‑realistic style, and a lively atmosphere, illuminated by bright fluorescent lighting.
