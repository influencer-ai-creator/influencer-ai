Italian professor Alessandra Vivaldi, late thirties, tall and curvy with long dark hair and a generous bust, wearing a low-cut silk blouse, high-waisted pencil skirt, and stiletto heels, standing confidently at the lectern holding a stack of papers, her blush-tinged cheeks and seductive gaze captivating the room; three male students in navy blazers and a female student in a pink cardigan look on in shocked awe, all in a bright, sunlit university lecture hall with large windows and polished wooden floors, captured from a slightly low angle to emphasize her commanding presence, cinematic golden hour lighting casting soft shadows, hyperrealistic style, warm color palette of amber and blush tones, studio lighting for clarity, detailed textures, realistic proportions.
