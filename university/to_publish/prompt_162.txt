A cinematic wide‑angle shot of a well‑lit university lecture hall at noon, golden hour sunlight streaming through tall windows, casting warm, soft highlights on a European adult woman, Professor Lila, mid‑30s, long wavy hair, tanned skin, large breasts, wearing a short black silk off‑shoulder blouse and a sheer white chiffon veil that drapes elegantly over her hips. She stands confidently in the center, hands poised over a glass of bubbling liquid, while a group of male students in crisp suits watch in admiration. The atmosphere is dreamy and slightly surreal, with a pastel color palette of soft blues and golds, hyper‑realistic style, high detail, and a subtle bokeh background to keep focus on her movement and expression.
