High-angle, hyperrealistic portrait of Dr. Isabella Rossi, a European Italian professor, in a bright lecture hall, mid-action flipping a large textbook. She wears a short blazer revealing a voluptuous bust, her golden hair falling over one shoulder. Natural daylight streams through large windows, creating a warm, romantic atmosphere with pastel tones. The scene includes several focused students in the background, a chalkboard filled with equations, and a stack of books on the desk. The composition has cinematic depth of field and a soft vignette, emphasizing the seductive academic vibe.
