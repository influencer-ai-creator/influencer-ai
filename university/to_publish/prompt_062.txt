A hyper‑realistic, low‑angle shot of Professor Celeste Vega, a European adult woman in her early thirties with strikingly large breasts, wearing a glittering low‑cut crop top and a sleek blazer, standing in a brightly lit university lecture hall. The scene captures her in mid‑gesture as she levitates a shiny red apple, her hands poised above it, while her chest subtly rises with each breath, the light casting soft golden highlights across her flawless skin. Around her, a group of attentive students—a young male and a female—look on in awe, their faces illuminated by the warm, pastel‑tinted light of late afternoon, creating a dreamy, surreal atmosphere. The composition emphasizes depth of field, with a slightly blurred background of white desks and a blackboard, while the foreground focuses on Celeste's expressive eyes and the glittering detail of her crop top. The color palette is pastel with accents of gold, and the overall style blends hyper‑realism with a touch of painterly softness.
