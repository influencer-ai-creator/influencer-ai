A high-resolution, well-lit scene in a university library, featuring Professor Elena Moretti, a European adult woman with long auburn hair, almond-shaped hazel eyes, porcelain skin, and prominent, shapely breasts, wearing a semi-transparent white blouse and a short plaid skirt, gently leaning over a mahogany desk while guiding a group of captivated students. The image is shot from a slightly low angle to accentuate her curves, with soft diffused natural light streaming through tall windows, creating a dreamy, romantic atmosphere. The color palette is warm golds and muted greens, with a subtle bokeh background. The style is hyper-realistic with cinematic lighting, reminiscent of a high-end fashion editorial.
