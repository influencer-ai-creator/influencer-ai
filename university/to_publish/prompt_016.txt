A hyperrealistic, cinematic portrait of Professor Lucia Varga, a European adult woman, standing in a sunlit university lecture hall. She wears a sheer silk blouse that barely covers her bust, revealing a tasteful hint of cleavage, and a flowing silk scarf. Her long dark hair cascades over her shoulders in loose waves, sparkling with a hint of gold. She holds a tray of glossy chocolate cupcakes, the glossy sheen reflecting warm golden hour light. A young male student in a denim hoodie leans against the lectern, gazing up at her with wide eyes. The camera angle is a low angle shot, dramatic spotlighting creates deep shadows and highlights her curves, dreamy atmosphere, pastel pink and teal color palette, anime style.
