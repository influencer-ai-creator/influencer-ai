A sunlit university quad in early morning light, captured from a low angle perspective, featuring Camille, a European adult woman with a strikingly toned bust and high cheekbones, wearing a sleeveless blazer with a low neckline and a form-fitting dress that highlights her generous breasts and accentuates her silhouette. She is walking forward while gesturing a lecture about quantum physics, surrounded by a small group of students and a supportive professor. The scene is bathed in warm golden tones, with cinematic lighting, realistic details, and a clear, crisp focus on Camille's motion. The camera captures the entire composition in a single shot, showing the main character's action, and includes other characters in the frame. The image has no visible genitals or nipples.
