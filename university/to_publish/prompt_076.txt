A well-lit university lecture hall with bright daylight filtering through large windows, a low camera angle looking up at the tall wooden podium. The focus is on Professor Emilia Rossi, a European adult woman with striking Mediterranean features, long auburn hair, a voluptuous bust, wearing a form-fitting crimson crop top that exposes her midriff and sleek black shorts, her pose seductive as she stands behind the podium. She holds a stack of glossy lecture notes, fingers teasingly brushing the pages. The scene includes a group of students in casual attire, gazing in admiration, and a small cluster of desks. The atmosphere is vibrant and sultry, with a warm color palette of gold and amber, soft natural lighting creating gentle shadows, and a subtle bokeh effect in the background. The style is hyper-realistic with cinematic lighting, reminiscent of a high-end fashion editorial.
