A high-resolution, low-angle, photorealistic illustration of Professor Elena, a European adult woman, in a brightly lit lecture hall. She wears a short pleated skirt and a cropped lace top, her long dark hair cascading over her shoulders, full bust accentuated by the fabric. Standing confidently near a chalkboard, she gestures with one hand while her student Luca, a male with short blonde hair and a casual hoodie, leans forward in a chair. The scene is bathed in soft golden hour light, creating a dreamy pastel atmosphere. Cinematic lighting, detailed textures, subtle depth of field focus on Elena's seductive pose.
