A hyper-realistic portrait of Dr. Lucia Valenti, a European Italian adult woman with striking almond eyes and a radiant smile, wearing a short, sparkling lab coat over a form-fitting black dress that accentuates her ample bust. She stands confidently at the front of a brightly lit modern university lab, the camera angled at a 45-degree close-up that captures her seductive posture as she flips a lever. Behind her, a few attentive students in crisp white coats watch, their expressions a mix of admiration and intrigue. The scene is bathed in warm golden light with a subtle teal accent, creating a cinematic, slightly stylized atmosphere reminiscent of a glossy magazine spread. The overall palette is rich and vibrant, blending warm golds, cool teals, and muted neutrals.
