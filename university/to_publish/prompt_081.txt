A hyperrealistic digital painting of a European adult woman professor, 30s, with large breasts, wearing a short white dress and a lab coat, standing on a rotating platform in a well‑lit chemistry lab with warm golden studio lighting. She is swirling a neon‑blue solution in a beaker, causing a splash of foam that glistens under the studio lights. Several students in casual clothing look on, their eyes wide with fascination. The camera angle is a side view, with a shallow depth of field highlighting the professor’s face and the swirling liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy and surreal, with a warm gold and red color palette, and the style is cinematic, high‑resolution, 4k.
