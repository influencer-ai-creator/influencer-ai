A hyperrealistic, soft-focus illustration of Professor Elena Ramirez, a 42-year-old Spanish European adult woman with long dark hair, large breasts, wearing a low-cut white crop top and form-fitting blue jeans, standing in a brightly lit university chemistry lab at golden hour, camera taken from a low angle to emphasize her height and curves as she demonstrates a reaction. Two male students in lab coats lean in, eyes wide, their faces slightly blurred to keep focus on Elena. The atmosphere feels dreamy with pastel tones, subtle rim lighting on her hair, and a slight bokeh background of lab equipment.
