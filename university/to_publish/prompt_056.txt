Hyper‑realistic close‑up portrait of a European adult woman professor named Vivienne standing in a bright, modern university chemistry lab. She has a curvaceous figure, large breasts, wearing a short lab coat and a translucent silk blouse that accentuates her cleavage, with a small splash of liquid gracefully draping over her thigh. The camera angle is slightly tilted, capturing her mischievous smile and the reflective sheen of the beaker in the background. Dramatic lighting with warm amber highlights and cool blue shadows creates a cinematic atmosphere, while a rich color palette of saturated greens, gold accents from the glassware, and neon pink touches on her coat adds vibrancy. Include a group of European adult women students in the blurred background, looking up in awe, their expressions adding to the scene's intensity. The style blends high‑fashion magazine realism with cinematic depth of field, giving the image a polished, editorial feel.
