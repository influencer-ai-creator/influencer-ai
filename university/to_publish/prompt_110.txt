A hyperrealistic, cinematic depiction of Professor Alessia Rossi, a European adult woman from Italy, standing in a bright lecture hall with warm golden sunlight pouring through large windows. She wears a sheer silk dress with a daring neckline that accentuates her large breasts, a translucent cape fluttering behind her, and holds a stack of books like a prop. The camera is angled low, emphasizing her height and voluptuous form, with soft natural lighting that highlights her flawless skin. Students sit in the rows, their faces turned toward her, gazing with exaggerated awe. The atmosphere is electric, with a subtle bokeh effect around the crowd, creating a dreamy, sensual vibe. The color palette is warm, saturated with golds and soft creams, and the lighting is bright and inviting. The image is detailed, focusing on the main character's seductive pose and the shimmering fabric of her dress.
