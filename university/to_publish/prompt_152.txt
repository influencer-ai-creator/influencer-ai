A high-resolution illustration of Lena, a European adult woman professor in her early 30s, with long wavy brunette hair, striking green eyes, a curvaceous figure with a prominent bust, wearing a short black blazer over a low-cut white blouse, high-waisted black trousers, standing confidently in a well-lit university lecture hall with polished marble floors and a large chalkboard behind her. The scene is captured from a slightly low camera angle, with soft natural light flooding the room, creating a warm, cinematic atmosphere. The color palette is muted with pops of blue from the professor's blazer, and the overall style is realistic with detailed textures and subtle depth of field.
