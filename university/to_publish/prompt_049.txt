A hyper‑realistic portrait of Professor Aurora Vivaldi, a European (Italian) adult woman, standing at the front of a brightly lit lecture hall under warm golden hour glow. Her long dark hair cascades over her shoulders, framing hazel eyes that sparkle with mischief. She wears a sheer, low‑cut white lab coat that drapes her toned, slightly curvy torso, revealing a subtle hint of cleavage and a pastel‑colored pencil skirt. In one hand she holds a stack of sparkling test tubes, while the other gestures dramatically as she points to a holographic projection of entangled particles on the blackboard. The camera angle is a slightly low, side‑profile shot, capturing her confident posture and the playful motion of her hair. The atmosphere is vibrant and energetic, with soft golden lighting casting gentle shadows, pastel‑tinted walls, and a clear focus on her dynamic movement. Students in the background—two male, one female—are shown in semi‑transparent uniforms, eyes wide, reacting to her seductive demonstration. The color palette leans toward warm pastel tones with silver and light blue accents for the hologram, giving a dreamy yet realistic look. The overall style is ultra‑detailed, cinematic, photorealistic, with high contrast and a slightly glossy finish.
