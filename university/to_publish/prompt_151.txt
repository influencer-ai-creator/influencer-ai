A photorealistic illustration of a European adult woman professor named Lucia, with long flowing brunette hair, a striking smile, and a pair of high-arched, oversized breasts that accentuate her figure, standing in a well-lit modern lecture hall. She wears a short silk blouse that reveals her midriff and a daringly low-cut pencil skirt that barely covers her hips, revealing a tasteful hint of thigh. The scene is captured from a low angle, emphasizing her dominance, with soft studio lighting casting gentle highlights on her curves. In front of her, a group of diverse, young university students – a mix of male and female, wearing casual academic attire – stare in awe, their eyes following her every movement. The atmosphere is romantic and playful, with a warm color palette of gold and amber tones, while subtle reflections on polished wooden desks add depth. All characters are realistic, capturing the surreal, absurdly sexy vibe, and the setting is a bustling university lecture hall full of desks and a whiteboard.
